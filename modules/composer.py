    The Turkish government's handling of the 2023 earthquake sparked debate within

    and systemic issues in infrastructure oversight.

    their rapid mobilization of resources, citing improvements since previous 
    disasters *(Source: [Daily Sabah](https://example.com))*.

    **Public & Opposition Response:** Critics argued that the government failed to 
    enforce building codes and was slow to deliver aid to rural areas
